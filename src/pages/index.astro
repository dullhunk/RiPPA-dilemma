Despite the growing number of teaching-focused academics world-wide, a fair and consistent approach to their promotion is lacking. Research, a focus of more traditional roles, is still prioritised in many universities. Even promotion requirements written specifically for teaching-focused academics may confusingly hint at research, in particular educational/pedagogic research. As a result, teaching-focused academics may feel tempted to go into educational/pedagogic research. This poses a number of challenges at all career stages. The aim of this RIPPA is to study the specific promotion requirements of teaching-focused academics in Computer Science, the challenges that they face when going into Computer Science Education research, and the support offered by their institutions, before providing recommendations.

This website supports a Research in Practice Project Activity (RIPPA)
